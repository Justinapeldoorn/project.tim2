Different Kinds of Loops

JavaScript supports different kinds of loops:

    for - loops through a block of code a number of times
    for/in - loops through the properties of an object
    while - loops through a block of code while a specified condition is true
    do/while - also loops through a block of code while a specified condition is true


Statement 1 sets a variable before the loop starts (var i = 0).

Statement 2 defines the condition for the loop to run (i must be less than 5).

Statement 3 increases a value (i++) each time the code block in the loop has been executed.


Statement 1

Normally you will use statement 1 to initialize the variable used in the loop (i = 0).

This is not always the case, JavaScript doesn't care. Statement 1 is optional.

You can initiate many values in statement 1 (separated by comma):


Statement 2

Often statement 2 is used to evaluate the condition of the initial variable.

This is not always the case, JavaScript doesn't care. Statement 2 is also optional.

If statement 2 returns true, the loop will start over again, if it returns false, the loop will end.


Statement 3

Often statement 3 increments the value of the initial variable.

This is not always the case, JavaScript doesn't care, and statement 3 is optional.

Statement 3 can do anything like negative increment (i--), positive increment (i = i + 15), or anything else.

Statement 3 can also be omitted (like when you increment your values inside the loop):
